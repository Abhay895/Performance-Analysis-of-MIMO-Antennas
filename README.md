# Performance-Analysis-of-MIMO-Antennas
This project presents the design and simulation of a 4Ã—4 MIMO antenna using CST Microwave Studio. Key performance metrics such as return loss, gain, bandwidth, efficiency, ECC, and isolation were analyzed. The results show that the antenna offers good diversity performance and is suitable for modern wireless applications like 5G and IoT.
